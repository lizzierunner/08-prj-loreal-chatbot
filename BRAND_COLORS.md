## 📖 Brand Story

From FutureBrand's work on L'Oréal:

> "A vibrant red was added to the customary black and white, making for a bold and contrasted palette, mirroring L'Oréal's passion and energy."

The brand identity is designed to be:
- **Bold** - Strong contrasts with black, white, and red
- **Contrasted** - Clear visual hierarchy
- **Energetic** - The red brings passion and vibrancy
- **Unified** - One strong voice across all departments

## 🎯 Design Elements

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Montserrat (sans-serif)
- **Distinctive**: L'Oréal uses a script font based on founder Eugène Schueller's handwriting for special occasions
- **Expressions**: Mix of serif and sans-serif for different contexts

### Logo
- The "O" from L'Oréal is a rallying symbol
- Based on the shape of the very first product ad
- Should be displayed prominently

### Visual Style
- Bold visual identity
- Sophisticated but fragile subtlety
- Apparent simplicity with deeper complexity
- Professional and premium feel
